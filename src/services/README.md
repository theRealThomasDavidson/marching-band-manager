# Services Directory

This directory contains service integrations and business logic implementations.

## Structure

- `/auth/` - Authentication services
- `/game/` - Game-related services
- `/database/` - Database services and repositories

## Purpose

The services directory handles external integrations, business logic, and data operations. It provides a clean separation between the UI layer and data/business logic layers.
